# superhero-generator

Created a character level language model that will predict the next character for a given input sequence. <br />
In order to get a new predicted superhero name, a seed input is given - this can be a single character or a sequence of characters <br />
The model will then generate the next character that it predicts should be after the input sequence <br />
This character is then added to the seed input to create a new input, which is then used again to generate the next character, and so on.
